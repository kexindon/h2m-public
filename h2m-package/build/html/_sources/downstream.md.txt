# H2M Database Online Portal

Online portal available at [https://human2mouse.com/](https://human2mouse.com/#/)

We pre-computed:

1. Murine equivalents of over 3,000,000 human variants derived from **ClinVar**, **COSMIC**, and **AACR-GENIE**;

2. Database of base editing gRNAs for engineering human and orthologous mouse variants–24,680 gRNAs targeting 2,720 human mutations and 1,892 mouse mutations.

3. Database of pegRNAs for engineering human and orthologous mouse variants–48,255 pegRNAs targeting 4,944 human mutations and 4,707 mouse mutations. 

## PEGG: Prime Editing Guide Generator  
[PEGG](https://pegg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a python package that designs prime editing guide RNAs (pegRNAs) and base editing guide RNAs (gRNAs) for use in precision genome editing. This package is compatible with the output of H2M for generating gRNAs and pegRNAs to engineer mutations of interest.
